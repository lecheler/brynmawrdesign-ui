# Button

The Button is the primary interactive affordance in the system. It favors
clarity and calm over decoration:

- **Inter** as the default typeface via a `--font-sans` token
- Compact sizing with padding driving hit area, not line-height hacks
- Sentence case labels for better scannability and localization
- Icon slots that maintain alignment and rhythm at all sizes

---

## Usage

Use the Button for primary and secondary actions, especially where a clear label
beats an icon-only affordance. Reserved, predictable behavior is more valuable
than clever styling.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--playground" />
</Canvas>

---

## Variants

Variants are **semantic**, not purely visual. They map to intent:

- `primary` – high-emphasis, single best next action on a surface
- `secondary` – supporting actions that are still important
- `ghost` – low-emphasis actions, often inline or tertiary options

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--variants" of={ButtonStories.Primary} />
</Canvas>

> **Guideline:** Avoid having more than one `primary` Button per view. If
> everything is emphasized, nothing is.

---

## Sizes

Button size is driven by layout density and input method:

- `sm` – dense UIs, tables, secondary actions
- `md` – default for desktop product surfaces
- `lg` – high-emphasis actions, mobile-first contexts

Text remains relatively small and neutral; padding establishes the touch target.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--sizes" />
</Canvas>

## Icons

Buttons support both leading and trailing icons via `iconLeading` and
`iconTrailing` props. Icon sizing is tokenized (`--icon-size-*`) so that
motion and layout remain consistent across the system.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--with-leading-icon" />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--with-trailing-icon" />
</Canvas>

> **Guideline:** Icons should clarify, not replace, the label. Avoid icon-only
> Buttons except for well-established patterns (e.g., a close or settings icon).

## API

### Props

{/* <ArgsTable of={ButtonStories.Playground} /> */}

### Design tokens

The Button consumes, but does not define, the following tokens:

- `--font-sans`
- `--font-size-xs`, `--font-size-sm`
- `--line-height-tight`
- `--space-1` through `--space-4`
- `--radius-sm`, `--radius-md`
- `--icon-size-xs`, `--icon-size-sm`
- `--button-primary-*`, `--button-secondary-*`, `--button-ghost-*`
- `--focus-ring-color`

This makes the component themeable across products while expressing a strong
default look and feel.

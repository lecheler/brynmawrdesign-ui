# Foundations

This system is built on a small set of stable foundations designed to disappear
in day-to-day product work while remaining flexible across products.

---

## Design tokens

Tokens define **design decisions**, not implementation details. Components
consume tokens; applications may override them.

- Color, spacing, typography, radius, motion
- No element selectors
- Portable across CSS, JS, and design tools

---

## Typography

Typography favors neutrality and clarity:

- Inter as the default UI sans-serif
- Compact sizes with generous spacing
- Sentence case for labels

Use `Text` and `Heading` primitives instead of styling raw elements.

---

## Layout

Layout primitives (`Stack`, `Inline`) replace margin-based composition.
They encode spacing intent and improve consistency across features.

---

## Accessibility

- Visible focus rings via tokens
- Buttons meet minimum touch targets
- Text sizes chosen for readability at common viewing distances

---

## Philosophy

This system optimizes for:

- Calm defaults
- Predictable behavior
- Consumer autonomy

Opinionated where it helps consistency, flexible where it supports adoption.

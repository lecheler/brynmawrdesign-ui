<Title>Bryn Mawr Design UI</Title>

<Subtitle>
  Internal React + TypeScript UI component library for Bryn Mawr Design.
</Subtitle>
<div>
  Bryn Mawr Design UI is a small, focused set of reusable UI primitives used
  across <code>brynmawrdesign-web</code> and other internal projects. It exists
  to capture stable patterns&mdash;like buttons, form fields, layout primitives,
  and feedback components&mdash;in one place, with a consistent visual language
  and accessible behavior.
</div>
## Goals

- Provide a consistent, token-driven visual foundation.
- Encapsulate shared interaction patterns (hover, focus, disabled, error).
- Make it easy to compose product UIs without re-solving basic UI problems.
- Serve as a clear artifact of my front-end and design-systems work.

## Design tokens

This library uses CSS custom properties defined in `tokens.css` to express:

- **Color**: brand, surface, text, borders, and semantic colors.
- **Spacing**: a small, predictable spacing scale.
- **Radius & shadow**: primitives for cards, buttons, and surfaces.
- **Typography**: font family and a simple size scale.

Components consume these tokens so that themes and visual refinements can
happen in one place instead of per-component.

## Components

The initial set of components focuses on small, composable building blocks:

- <strong>Button</strong> – primary, secondary, and ghost button variants with
  size options.
- <strong>TextField</strong> – basic text input with consistent styling.
- <strong>FormField</strong> – label + help text + error messaging wrapper.
- <strong>Layout primitives</strong> – simple building blocks like
  <code>Stack</code> and <code>Box</code>.
- <strong>Feedback</strong> – components such as <code>Modal</code> or
  <code>Toast</code> (added incrementally).

You can explore these in the <em>Components</em> section of the sidebar.

## Usage

In a consuming app (for example, <code>brynmawrdesign-web</code>), components
are imported from the library and composed into product UIs:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@brynmawrdesign/ui";

export function Example() {
  return <Button variant="primary">Save changes</Button>;
}
```
